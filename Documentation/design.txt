DarkSSTV is a 4QAM 48000khz 512 sample symbol data rate, 2.5khz wide.

Each frame is 100 fft symbols long.

Each fft symbol holds 5 bytes of data

FFT layout:
3: Pilot tone at 0 degrees normally, and 180 degrees on the start of a frame
7: Morse carrier to ID
8-29: 4QAM data bits.

Frame 0 layout (Retransmitted every 20 frames):
short: Frame ID
short: Length of sequence
short: Type of Data 1 = file, 2 = sstv
int: Length of viterbi data
byte: Length of callsign
string: Callsign
byte: Length of filename
string: Filename
byte: Length of comment
